# World Wise

Picture a minimalist yet powerful travel companion designed to map out your journeys effortlessly. Built with React, this app provides a clean interface for users to pin their global destinations with ease. Using React Router for seamless single-page navigation, it ensures a smooth experience as you explore your travel log. Each pinpoint on the map signifies a unique location, serving as a digital footprint of your adventures. Leveraging Supabase as its backend service, the app manages data efficiently, allowing users to store and retrieve their travel history effortlessly. 
It's not just a tool, it's a personal travel journal, enabling users to reflect on past trips and plan future ones with simplicity and precision.
